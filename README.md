# UV-C Light Meter
Low Cost UV-C Light Meter with Dual Sensor Input and Data Logging

## Background
UV-C based devices are being widely developed on comercial and hobby levels in response to COVID-19. As a result,
there is a shortage of testing equipment including UV-C meters. Hence I developed this low cost solution that can 
be used to measure UV-C intesity. 

## Features
The meter features a small and compact form factor with an oled display. I has a built in RTC and SD card to log
time stamped measurements. It can be used with upto two sensors and further sensors can be added with some modification. 

## Bill of Materials
**Note:** I used the Adafruit Feather ecosystem of development boards for this project for their ease of use and quick assembly. But this meter can
be made using a wide variety of parts so feel free to go for a cheaper option. 
| Part Name | Part Number | Description | Digikey Link |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Genicom UV-C Sensor | GUVC-T10GM-LA | This is the sensor used to measure UV-C intesity. It comes precalibrated on a small PCB with an opamp to give a linear analog output.| [GUVC-T10GM-LA](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/genicom-co-ltd/GUVC-T10GM-LA/2096-GUVC-T10GM-LA-ND/10474940) |
| Adafruit Feather M4 Express | 3857 | I used the Feather M4 for its 10bit ADC but you can use any Feather you want. | [Adafruit Feather M4 Express](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/adafruit-industries-llc/3857/1528-2648-ND/9553567)|
